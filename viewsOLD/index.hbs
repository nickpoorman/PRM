      What is Regattable?
      <blockquote><span class="muted">Regattable is a new breed of innovative, portable sailboats boasting great performance and sleek design.</span><blockquote>
    </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        This is a new startup venture out of Syracuse, New York, the heart of local sailing communities, with expanding potential for economic impact due to the close proximity of NYC and other large urban areas such as Boston and Philly.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Any sailor knows that the transport and storage of sailboats is expensive and a hassle. Most sailboat owners have trailers, which have to be registered every year, and need a place to be stored. If you live in a city, just forget even having a boat unless you can afford a slip, which have become so expensive only the most wealthy can afford them. Regattable solves these problems and we are building the first 16-foot high performance collapsible catamaran sailboat that performs just like the real thing, can be stored in a closet and transported by car or plane.

        Any boat worth sailing is worth racing. Not only do we believe it's our duty to build sailboats that are extremely easy to transport, we also believe it's our duty to build sailboats that can perform above and beyond when pushed to their limits.

        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
          In the past, sailors often found transporting boats to be extremely painful. There are a great number of preparations required when transporting a boat by trailer, such as having the trailer inspected and registered, checking the brake lights, and also strapping everything down. Regattable was born in the minds of our engineers who have come up with a solution to this problem.</p>
          <p class="lead">
            Traditional collapsible or portable sailboats utilize inflatable hulls. Although this alternative is compelling when considering portability, the boats do not perform like true sailboats. Using state-of-the art technology Regattable brings performance and portability into the sailing industry.

        Our design utilizes space age materials such as carbon fiber and nylon composites to bring to light a high performance sailboat that can be stored in a closet and transported by car or plane. Not only does our design allow for collapsibility, it provides ease of transport due to its low weight. With rigorous testing through software simulations, prototyping and re-iteration of design Regattable strives to bring forth a high-quality product worth sailing.

        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
          During the inception of Regattable we gave performance a great deal of thought. We wanted to build a sailboat that was fun and enjoyable for families but could also be raced by competitive sailors. In the past, boats have been designed with a vast number of optional performance upgrades, making competitive racing extremely costly to sailors. By racing one-design or in the case of our boats, one-make racing (where all racers are required to have a stock boat), we are able to keep cost lower for anyone wishing to race competitively.
